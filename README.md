This is a Simple News app Which uses News Api to fetch news around the world, You can use your api key and replace it with mine, if you wish to deploye the site, you can get the api key from "https://newsapi.org/".

You can use the app in yopur local host just write npm run start on you terminal after installing all the required packages.

I have name the app Big News as an inspiration from the one piece anime character.
